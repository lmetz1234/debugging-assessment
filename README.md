Debugging assessment to certify teachers to use Operation Spark FSD curriculum

Each of the folders in this repo contains a major project from the Fundamentals of Software Development curriculum. They are each "completed" projects but are full of errors. Your task is to debug these projects so they behave as expected. 

## first-website
The file `index.html-key.png` will be your guide for how the website should look once completed. You may also use the `README.md` for guidance to see the instructions for correctly building this website. 

## circularity
This project should run error-free. The behavior of the program should follow these expectations:
- the circles move randomly around the screen
- if a circle leaves the screen, once it has _fully_ exited the screen on any of the four sides, it will re-enter the view from off-screen.

## runtime
This project should run error-free. The behavior of the program should follow these expectations:
- The background should contain various images / shapes that are laid out in the proper order
- There should be multiple enemies / obstacles present in the game
- Hallebot should be able to collide with enemies and obstacles
- Hallebot should be able to shoot enemeies.
